# World Energy Visualization

## Welcome

This dashboard has a goal to provide an easy access to information related to types of energy consumed at every
country and multiple regions over the last few decades. If you are interested in climate change and transition to
energy sources, this dashboard may bring you some insight!

## What are we doing

### Our Motivation

Climate change is an imminent threat to humanity. Therefore, the switch to renewable and nuclear energy from fossil
fuels is paramount in mitigating its effects. We believe a simple dashboard visuallization can help people understand
the current global situation.

### Problems we are trying to solve

Though there are annual reports and other sources that detail the trends in global energy consumption, these are
often static representations of the data. Therefore it can be difficult to visualize trends over time and compare
the trends for the different sources of energy. This dashboard aims to facilitate the analysis of the type of energy
consumed over time and identify the countries leading the transition to alternative energy. The user will be able to
filter for the type of energy and year and view the consumption patterns globally. The time series plots this dashboard
provides can be used to compare the performance of selected countries against the global and regional averages over time.

### Why is it important

Let us do the heavy lifting. I am sure you are as passionate about the climate change and energy consumption as us.
You may be a student who are studying global environmental analysis. You may be a policy maker who wants to identify
countries that have effective green policies. Whatever your reasons behind your need of this information, we want to save
your time in wraggling complex data. Let us analyze the data for you so you don't have to.

## Description of the Dashboard

![](doc/demo.gif)

As can be seen on short demonstration above World Energy Visualizatoin dashboard onsists of two tabs, where the first tab provides a high level overview,
while the second tab gives a more granular detailed information about trends for energy consuption over many years.  

In the main dashboard users are able gain an insight about countries with some dominant type of energy, such as "nuclear", "fossil fuel" or "renewable energy". This is realized with visualization of the world map colored by a fraction of energy type consumed in each country. Also with a simple switch, users of the dashboard can identify countries at the bottom of the list, which are lagging behind in adoption of certain type of energy.

At the second tab of the dashboard, users can select one or a few countries for comparison between each
other or with certain regions.

## Contributing to this Dashboard

If you have any ideas regarding to this project and wish to help, you are welcome to contribute.  

### What do we need

Pontential features include:

* Add an chronological animation to the world map
* Visualization of locations & production of power plants
* Trends of energy consumption & producton by individual source of energy

You are also welcomed to raise new ideas and report any existing bugs. 

### How to install and run locally

To run the dashboard locally, it is recommeded to use a virtual environment like [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). For simplicity, we could demonstrate the installiation process with venv.

#### Set up

Run the following command at the root directory of the project:

```
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv energy-viz

# Activate the environment
source energy-viz/bin/activate

# Install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the dashboard

```
python src/app.py
```

The dashboard could then be accessed locally in <localhost:8050>, and you are good to go!
